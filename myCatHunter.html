    <h1>All about Hunter</h1>
    <h4>My Domestic Shorthair cat with black and brown fur.</h4>
    <hr> <br>
    <p>Hunter is still a kitten at 18 weeks old and was originally named as such because we thought she was a boy. However, the name Hunter is apropos to her energy when playing
        and suits a female cat. She doesn't talk much except for when she wants attention and is becoming fussy when it comes to her wet food.
